# OCI-Auto-Scripts

This repo is for collecting scripts when you use Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), especially when you need to operate mutliple resources at once.

The script could be writen based on OCI CLI command, or python/C#/Java code based on OCI SDK.

# Prerequisites

You have to setup related OCI CLI or SDK envrionment before running the code directly.
Follow the Oracle Offical documents about how to setup related envrionment.

CLI setup: https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/cliconcepts.htm

SDK setup: https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/sdks.htm

You could also run these on CloudShell instead your own workstation/laptop.
